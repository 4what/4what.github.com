<v Narrator>Mobile technology has evolved rapidly</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.810
over the past few years and has shrunk the whole world

3
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.240
into a pocket sized device which can do more

4
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.670
than we could imagine a few years back.

5
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.060
Even with years of progress and innovation,

6
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.401
we still have to deal with speed, latency,

7
00:00:15.401 --> 00:00:18.330
signal loss, and low battery life issues.

8
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.270
But with the introduction of 5G,

9
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.500
all such worries can be put aside.

10
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.610
5G promises extremely fast, seamless,

11
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.007
and rich mobile experiences almost everywhere.

12
00:00:29.007 --> 00:00:32.411 line:15% 
5G is here to stay and Motorola is embracing

13
00:00:32.411 --> 00:00:35.909
the technology by introducing 5G Moto Mod.

14
00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:38.420
Feel the power of 5G by upgrading

15
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.593
your Moto z3 phones before anyone else can.
